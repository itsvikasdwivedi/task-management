# Task Management App

This is a Task Management App built using **Next.js**. The app allows users to manage their tasks with features like adding, editing, deleting, completing tasks, and searching through tasks. It also uses **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for initial task loading and **local storage** for persisting tasks between sessions.

- Next.js
- React (with Hooks)

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Local Storage Management

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:
   - The app uses **getServerSideProps** to load the initial task list from an array during the server-side rendering phase. This ensures that tasks are available on the first page load, even before JavaScript runs in the browser.

- **Local Storage**:
   - After the initial SSR data is loaded, tasks are stored and managed in **local storage** on the client side. When users add, edit, or delete tasks, these changes are saved to local storage, so the task list persists between page reloads.

   - The app checks for tasks in local storage on every page load. If tasks exist, it loads them; otherwise, it defaults to the SSR-provided tasks.
